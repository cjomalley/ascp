# My Advice on ASCP Certification
### General Information about ASCP Certification
Do you have a bachelor's degree in a life science but are unable to find a job? Does the idea of working in a medical diagnostic laboratory appeal to you? ASCP certification may be a good career path for you. The majority of bachelor's degree holders who work in medical diagnostics laboratories in the US are working as Medical Laboratory Scientists, formerly known as Medical Technologists. These jobs pay between $20 and $40 per hour, depending on what region you work in and your level of experience. Medical Laboratory Scientists carry out testing on blood, urine, other bodily fluids, and tissues collected from a patient. When you go to an urgent care to get a diagnosis of a UTI, when you get your cholesterol levels checked as part of an annual physical, or when you get a nasopharyngeal swab done for COVID-19, your urine, blood, or swab goes to a medical diagnostic laboratory and is processed and tested by people with various levels of ASCP certification.

There are two main areas of ASCP certification, and while there can be crossover between these areas, for the most part there are separate schools and education programs for each of these areas.
##### General Laboratory
This includes phlebotomists who draw blood from patients, clinical/medical laboratory assistants who process specimens, and medical laboratory technicians and scientists who perform testing on specimens. People working in this area of the laboratory may have educational backgrounds anywhere from high school through holding a Ph.D. or M.D. While personnel who process specimens may have a high school, associate's degree, or bachelor's degree educational backround and may not always have an ASCP certification, any personnel who perform actual specimen testing and who report results typically must have some kind of certification to do so, for which ASCP is the most common nationally-recognized certifying body. The common ASCP certifications held by personnel working in a general laboratory may include MLT, MLS, H, C, BB, or M. Larger laboratories or laboratories that offer a wide variety of services or specialties may also employ people with less-common ASCP certifications.
##### Anatomic Pathology
This includes pathologists and their assistants, personnel working in histology, and personnel working in cytology. The majority of the diagnostic testing performed in an anatomic pathology laboratory is related to cancer diagnostics, screening, and staging, but these laboratories also play a role in diagnosing infectious diseases and genetic or other cellular abnormalities. 
### M(ASCP) - Technologist in Microbiology
The M(ASCP) certification enables you to work at the same level as a Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS) or Medical Technologist (MT) ASCP certification, but only within a microbiology department. 
##### How to Get Certified
If you have a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry, biology, or another "life science," and you have taken at least 30 semester units of chemistry and biology courses, you are eligible for M(ASCP) certification programs. An NAACLS-accredited certification program will cover the microbiology component of the full MLS certification program. It will also contain a rotation in a microbiology department as part of the curriculum. University of North Dakota has categorical certifications available in microbiology, hematology, chemistry, and blood banking. 
### MB(ASCP) - Technologist in Molecular Biology
The MB(ASCP) certification enables you to work at the same level as a Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS) or Medical Technologist (MT) ASCP certification, but only within a molecular biology department. Not all laboratories have a separate molecular biology department. Some laboratories may have a separate virology & other infectious disease molecular biology department, and such departments may require MB(ASCP) certification rather than MLS(ASCP) certification.
##### How to Get Certified
If you have a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry, biology, or another "life science," and you already have any of the other main technologist-level certifications such as the MLS, M, C, H, or BB certifications, you are eligible to take the MB(ASCP) certification exam.

### M(ASCP) - Technologist in Microbiology
The M(ASCP) certification enables you to work at the same level as a Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS) or Medical Technologist (MT) ASCP certification, but only within a microbiology department. 
##### How to Get Certified
If you have a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry, biology, or another "life science," and you have taken at least 30 semester units of chemistry and biology courses, you are eligible for M(ASCP) certification programs. An NAACLS-accredited certification program will cover the microbiology component of the full MLS certification program. It will also contain a rotation in a microbiology department as part of the curriculum. University of North Dakota has categorical certifications available in microbiology, hematology, chemistry, and blood banking. 
### MB(ASCP) - Technologist in Molecular Biology
The MB(ASCP) certification enables you to work at the same level as a Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS) or Medical Technologist (MT) ASCP certification, but only within a molecular biology department. Not all laboratories have a separate molecular biology department. Some laboratories may have a separate virology & other infectious disease molecular biology department, and such departments may require MB(ASCP) certification rather than MLS(ASCP) certification.
##### How to Get Certified
If you have a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry, biology, or another "life science," and you already have any of the other main technologist-level certifications such as the MLS, M, C, H, or BB certifications, you are eligible to take the MB(ASCP) certification exam.

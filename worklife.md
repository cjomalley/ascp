# What is it like to work in a clinical microbiology lab?
### How did you get into clinical microbiology?
I graduated in 2016 with a Bachelor of Science in chemistry and immediately discovered that having just a bachelor's degree wasn't going to get me many great job opportunities. I worked as a processor in a clinical cytology laboratory for several years and went back to school to become qualified for an M(ASCP) certification, which is a certification that allows you to practice clinical microbiology in labs contracted with Medicare, which is pretty much every medical diagnostics lab in the US. I later got an MB(ASCP) certification in molecular biology to help with future job prospects. I work between 20 and 40 hours a week in a busy medium-sized hospital laboratory that does bacteriology, virology, mycology (molds and yeasts), and some parasitology. 
### What does a typical work day look like?
Clinical laboratories operate around-the-clock. Most staff where I work have either eight-hour or ten-hour shifts, and the day is divided into day/evening/night shifts, sometimes also referred to as first/second/third. I work ten hour days, and I work a mix of evenings and nights. The majority of staff in the laboratory work day shift and are present during business operational hours when we are seeing patients as part of our clinical practice. There are two types of non-management staff in our department: "techs," who hold the Medical Laboratory Scientist title and have an MLS(ASCP), MT(ASCP), or M(ASCP) certification, and processors, who have educational backgrounds varying from high school to B.S. degrees. Processors receive incoming specimens and prepare them for testing. Techs perform testing, identify organisms, and report results. Techs are typically assigned to a "bench" on any given workday, which is a set of related tasks that must all be performed during that shift. 
### Processing
Both techs and processors are able to process, and on high-volume days or under unusual circumstances (like a pandemic), techs may participate in processing as their assigned task or during downtime. What needs to be done to process a specimen in a microbiology lab varies from specimen to specimen and depends on what tests are ordered, so processors have to remember quite a lot of stuff in order to be efficient. In my opinion this job is much more difficult and physically demanding than the job of the techs, even though processors are typically paid less. A specimen generally goes through the following steps during processing:
- Accessioning and order entry, which is when the specimen label is examined and looked up in the LIMS (laboratory information management system) to verify that the correct patient name and identifiers are present and to figour out which tests have been ordered. 
  - This may involve cancelling tests and ordering the correct test for a particular specimen or calling a physician to ask for clarification on what they actually want done, as doctors sometimes order incorrect or nonsensical tests for a particular type of specimen. 
  - This may also involve rejecting the specimen and calling a nurse or physician to request recollection. Specimen collection technique matters a lot more than you might expect, and sometimes we get things that weren't collected correctly and we won't proceed with testing them because the results of the test could be invalid or the specimen could be contaminated. Sometimes patients lose the sterile specimen collection containers they're given and they bring in stool or urine samples in non-sterile containers like a margarine tub that they ran through the "sterilization" cycle on their dishwasher. Sometimes doctors or nurses collect stuff incorrectly too. We get a lot of "sputum" that is actually just spit. 
- Actual processing of the specimen, which varies wildly from case to case and may involve centrifugation, tissue grinding, transferring part of the specimen into other tubes to be run through diferent instruments (lab equipment), or plating the specimen on appropriate agar.
  - Plating the specimen means to take a small amount of the specimen, usually a liquid, and use a sterile plastic stick called a loop to streak it gently across the surface of a petri dish filled with agar using a particular streaking pattern. Agar, or media, is a type of gel that contains various nutrients, antibiotics, dyes, or inhibiting agents that will help some bacteria grow or prevent others from growing. This is for the main part of our lab work, bacteriology, which is the identification of bacteria growing in a specimen. Plates are then put in an incubator at the appropriate temperature for the testing desired. An incubator is (and looks like) the opposite of a fridge. It's just a big tall warm box. 
- Storage or transfer of the specimen, which also is highly dependent on specimen type and tests ordered. We want to be able to redo testing or remake our agar plates if something goes wrong later on in the process, so we make sure to retain specimens at an appropriate temperature so that the specimen won't degrade and so that any bacteria (or virus or mold or yeast) present in the specimen won't be destroyed. 
Techs typically don't do processing on day or evening shift, so I don't do much of this part of the work anymore, but on night shift I used to work alone and so I did all my own processing for anything that came in. In a smaller lab a tech might help with processing all the time, but in a larger commercial lab a tech may never ever process and in fact might not be allowed to because they aren't considered "competent" on it since they don't do it enough and might mess it up.

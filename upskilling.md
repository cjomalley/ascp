# Upskilling Guide for Medical Laboratory Scientists
## What paths can you take after working as an MLS?
People with laboratory experience and a willingness to learn more computer skills can readily move into a wide variety of jobs in information technology, software development, and data science. The best way to figure out if this career move is right for you and to start making yourself a desirable candidate for these jobs is to start learning computer science and data analytics skills. There are many resources available online and many good programs at universities and community colleges. This page will provide an overview of some of the available resources and some general advice on good moves to improve your chances of getting a job in these fields.
Jobs to look out for include LIS specialist, bioinformaticist, data scientist, data analyst, technical specialist, and jobs in IT. Some IT jobs related to hospitals and laboratories are looking to hire people who have a background in the laboratory sciences or who have worked in a laboratory already in their careers. 
## Free and cheap online resources
The best way to get started is to try out a little bit of programming. Sites like HackerRank and Codecademy have free resources for learning a huge variety of programming languages, including puzzles and lessons. Trying out a few puzzles on HackerRank is a good way to see what a programming environment is like without having to set anything up on your personal computer. If you're the type of learner who needs structured classes, paid services like Coursera, edX, and Udemy have many beginner-level programming and data science courses available.
Good languages and software programs to start learning include Excel, Tableau, R, Python, and SQL. Programs like Excel and Tableau are used more by people in data science who would be analyzing information and presenting it to other parties. Programming languages like R and Python are used more by people working in software development or data science that involves significant amounts of raw data processing or data collection.
## Certifications
